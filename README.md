File_Lock – A Ceremony-Driven Audio Sealing Experience

File_Lock is a handcrafted, Rust-powered application designed to preserve music tracks within a digital time capsule. Inspired by legacy and memory, it creates a secure, ceremonial experience where songs or spoken-word pieces are sealed away—untouchable until a predetermined moment in the future.

Built using the Wayland protocol through the Smithay compositor framework, File_Lock provides a visually rich and minimal frontend that interacts directly with users. Its drag-and-drop interface allows participants to place tracks into the capsule with intention and ritual. Once dropped, files are cryptographically locked, timestamped, and visually confirmed—creating a moment of finality and meaning.

What makes File_Lock unique:

🌐 Offline-first: Designed to operate completely without internet—perfect for remote ceremonies or secure archival.
🔒 Immutable Sealing: Tracks are encrypted and stored with tamper-proof signatures, symbolizing commitment and trust.
🖼️ Interactive GUI: Lightweight Wayland interface offers real-time visual feedback during the sealing process.
🛠️ Rust-secure Core: Built from the ground up in Rust, ensuring performance, reliability, and safety.
Whether used in community heritage ceremonies, private artistic milestones, or memorial sound capsules, File_Lock transforms digital music into a moment of memory—sealed in code, preserved for the future.
